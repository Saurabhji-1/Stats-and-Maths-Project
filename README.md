1. Data Handling
Key Concepts
Handling missing data using methods like:
Imputation (mean, median, mode).
Removing rows/columns with excessive missing values.
Converting data types to ensure compatibility, improve performance, and avoid errors.
Example Use Case
Preparing a sales dataset by filling missing values in sales columns with the median and ensuring the time column is in the correct datetime format.

2. Statistical Analysis
T-Test
A statistical test for comparing means between two groups.
Example: Comparing average sales revenue between two regions to determine if differences are statistically significant.
Chi-Square Test for Independence
Used to test relationships between two categorical variables.
Example: Testing if shipping mode (e.g., Standard, Express) is independent of customer segment (e.g., Consumer, Corporate).
3. Univariate and Bivariate Analysis
Univariate Analysis
Focuses on one variable.
Example: Analyzing the distribution of monthly sales revenue using histograms or boxplots.
Bivariate Analysis
Examines relationships between two variables.
Example: Exploring the correlation between advertising spend and monthly sales using scatterplots and correlation coefficients.
4. Data Visualization
Correlation Matrix
Benefits:
Summarizes relationships between multiple variables.
Identifies highly correlated features for predictive modeling.
Example: Visualizing the correlation between sales, profit, and advertising spend.
Sales Trends Over Time
Use line charts to observe fluctuations in sales over time.
Example: Plotting monthly sales to identify seasonal trends and applying moving averages for smoothing.
5. Sales and Profit Analysis
Identifying Top-Performing Product Categories
Steps:
Aggregate sales and profit by product category.
Rank categories to identify high-performing products.
Example: A bar chart displaying total sales and profit for each category.
Analyzing Seasonal Trends
Use time series analysis to decompose sales data into trend, seasonality, and residual components.
Example: Detecting peak sales periods during holidays.
6. Grouped Statistics
Importance
Analyzing grouped statistics provides insights into patterns and differences across categories.
Example: Calculating total sales, average profit margin, and transaction counts by region to identify high-performing markets.
Visualization
Bar charts or heatmaps for comparing regional performance.
Example: A dual-axis plot showing total sales and average profit margin for each region.
Technologies and Tools
Python Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels.
Visualization Tools: Tableau, Power BI, Excel.
Datasets: Historical sales data, customer segmentation, and shipping information.
